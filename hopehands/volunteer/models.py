"""
This file defines the Django models for the volunteer application.
Models are the single, definitive source of information about your data.
They contain the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing.
Django follows the DRY Principle. The goal is to define your data model in one
place and automatically derive things from it.

In this application, the Volunteer model is used to temporarily store volunteer
data before it is sent to HubSpot. It also serves as the basis for the
`VolunteerForm`.
